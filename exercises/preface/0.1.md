To answer this question I have to find out what are some properties of
programming languages. Then, I can write down the properties and for each
property write the languages which have it.

List of properties and their languages:

- Static typing
  - Manifest typing
    - C++, C#, Java
  - Type inference
    - Haskell, ML
- Dynamic typing
  - Lisp, Scheme, Python, Ruby
- Higher-order functions
  - Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, ML
- Lazy evaluation
  - Haskell
- Eager evaluation
  - Lisp, Scheme
- Object-oriented
  - Java, Scala
