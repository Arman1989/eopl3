Mathematically, we'd represent a stack by a function `s : N -> X` where `N` is
the set of natural numbers and `X` is the set of all elements on the stack.

```
(empty-stack) = [∅]

(push x [s]) = [t] such that t(n) = x     , if n == 0
                                  = s(n-1), if n > 0

(pop [s]) = undefined                             , if s == ∅
          = [r] such that r(n) = s(n+1) for n >= 0, otherwise

(top [s]) = undefined, if s == ∅
          = s(0)     , otherwise

(empty-stack? [s]) = s == ∅
```

The constructors are: `empty-stack`, `push`, `pop`.

The observers are: `top`, `empty-stack?`
