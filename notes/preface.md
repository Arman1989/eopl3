# Preface

The book is an analytic study of programming languages.

Most of these essentials relate to the semantics. Meanings reflect how program
elements are interpreted.

The most interesting question about a program is "What does it do?"

Interpreters are critical because:

1. They reveal nuances of meaning.
2. They are the direct path to more efficient compilation and to other kinds of
   program analyses.

Continuation-passing style is a powerful programming tool, for it allows any
sequential control mechanism to be implemented in almost any language.

Modules allow us to build and enforce abstraction boundaries.
