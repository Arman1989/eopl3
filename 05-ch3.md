# Expressions

## Key Points

We always need a front end that converts programs into abstract syntax trees.

It's all basically interpreters.

...

## Notes

In this chapter, we study the binding and scoping of variables.

### 3.1 Specification and Implementation Strategy

The specification will consist of assertions of the form

```
(value-of exp ρ) = val
```

meaning that the value of expression `exp` in environment `ρ` is `val`.

**Execution via interpreter**

*program text -> [Front End] -> syntax tree -> [Interpreter] -> answer*

**Execution via compiler**

*program text -> [Front End] -> syntax tree -> [Compiler] -> translated program -> [Interpreter or Machine] -> answer*

The **source language** or **the defined language** is the text of the program
written in the language we are implementing.

The **implementation language** or **the defining language** is the language in
which the interpreter is written.

In the compiler organization the **target language** is often machine language,
which is interpreted by a hardware machine. Another possibility is that the
target language is a special-purpose language called a **byte-code**, and its
interpreter is called a **virtual machine**.

A compiler is typically divided into 2 parts:

1. An **analyzer**. It attempts to deduce useful information about the program.
2. A **translator**. It does the translation, possibly using information from
the analyzer.

No matter what implementation strategy we use, we need a front end that converts
programs into abstract syntax trees.

The front end can be grouped into 2 stages:

1. **Scanning**. It is the process of dividing the sequence of characters into
words, numbers, punctuation, comments and the like. These units are called
**lexical items**, **lexemes** or **tokens**. The **lexical specification**
specifies the way in which a program should be divided up into tokens.

2. **Parsing**. It is the process of organizing the sequence of tokens into
hierarchical syntactic structures such as expressions, statements and blocks.
We refer to this as the **syntactic** or **grammatical** structure of the
language. The parser takes a sequence of tokens from the scanner and produces
an abstract syntax tree.

The standard approach to building a front end is to use a **parser generator**.
A parser generator is a program that takes a lexical specification and a
grammar, and produces a scanner and a parser for them.
