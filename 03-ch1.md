# Inductive Sets of Data

## Key Points

Ways of defining sets of values:

- Inductive specification
  - Types of definitions: top-down, bottom-up, rules of inference
- Grammars

Defining sets inductively allows us to:

1. Prove theorems about the members of the set.

2. Write programs that manipulate them.

## Notes

This chapter introduces the basic programming tools we will need.

Recursion will be at the core of our techniques.

### 1.1 Recursively Specified Data

This section introduces formal techniques for specifying sets of values.

Inductive specification is a powerful method of specifying a set of values.

**Top-down definition**

*Why is it a top-down definition?*

1. We start at the number `n`. (at the top)

2. We continue to subtract 3 from it until one of the conditions hold. (break
it down)

Top-down definitions can be used to test for inclusion in the inductively
defined set of values.

**Bottom-up definition**

*Why is it a bottom-up definition?*

1. We start with elements in the set. (from the bottom)

2. We use the rules to generate more elements that can be in the set. (build it
up)

**Rules of inference**

It's a shorthand notation for a bottom-up definition. The way the rules are
interpreted automatically make the set being defined the smallest set that is
closed under the rules.

Bottom-up definitions and rules of inference can be used to generate elements
for the inductively defined set of values.

**Grammars**

Describing more complex data types can become cumbersome. Grammars can help.

Grammars are typically used to specify sets of strings, but we can use them
to define sets of values as well.

**Nonterminal symbols:** These are the names of the sets being defined. These
sets are sometimes called syntactic categories.

**Terminal symbols:** These are the characters in the external representation.

**Productions:** The rules. Each production has a LHS, which is a nonterminal
symbol, and a RHS, which consists of terminal and nonterminal symbols. The LHS
and RHS are usually separated by the symbol `::=`, read "is" or "can be". The
RHS specifies a method for constructing members of the syntactic category.

Some syntactic categories mentioned in a production are left undefined when
their meaning is sufficiently clear from context.

**Context-sensitive constraints**

The grammars defined on pages 8-9 are said to be context-free because a rule
defining a given syntactic category may be applied in any context that makes
reference to that syntactic category.

Sometimes this is not restrictive enough.

Consider binary search trees:

```
Binary-search-tree ::= () | (Int Binary-search-tree Binary-search-tree)
```

This correctly describes the structure of each node but ignores an important
fact about binary search trees: all keys in the left subtree are less than (or
equal to) the key in the current node, and all the keys in the right subtree
are greater than the key in the current node.

Because of this additional constraint, not every syntactic derivation from
`Binary-search-tree` leads to a correct binary search tree.

To fix this we can use context-sensitive constraints or invariants.

Context-sensitive constraints also arise when specifying the syntax of
programming languages. For e.g. having variables declared before they are used.

In practice, the usual approach is to first specify a context-free grammar.
Context-sensitive constraints are then added using other methods.

**Induction**

Once sets are defined inductively we can use the definitions in two ways:

1. To prove theorems about members of the set.
2. To write programs that manipulate them.

**Structural Induction**

To prove properties of inductively defined sets of values we can use **proof by
structural induction**.

To prove that a proposition is true for all structures s, prove the following:

1. It is true on simple structures (those without substructures).

2. If it is true on the substructures of s, then it is true on s itself.

## 1.2 Deriving Recursive Programs

We can analyze an element of an inductively defined set to see how it is built
from smaller elements of the set. We can use this idea to define procedures that
compute on inductively defined sets.

**The Smaller-Subproblem Principle**

*If we can reduce a problem to a smaller subproblem, we can call the procedure
that solves the problem to solve the subproblem.*

The idea is illustrated with 5 examples:

- `list-length`
- `nth-element`
- `remove-first`
- `occurs-free?`
- `subst`

The Kleene star gives a concise description, but it is not so helpful for
writing programs.

The implementation of `subst` lead to mutual recursion which was foreshadowed
by the structure of its input.

The decomposition of `subst` into two procedures, one for each syntactic
category, is an important technique. It allows us to think about one syntactic
category at a time, which greatly simplifies our thinking about more complicated
programs.

**Follow the Grammar**

*When defining a procedure that operates on inductively defined data, the
structure of the program should be patterned after the structure of the data.*

More precisely:

- Write one procedure for each nonterminal in the grammar. The procedure will
be responsible for handling the data corresponding to that nonterminal, and
nothing else.

- In each procedure, write one alternative for each production corresponding to
that nonterminal. You may need additional case structure, but this will get
you started. For each nonterminal that appears in the right-hand side, write a
recursive call to the procedure for that nonterminal.

## 1.3 Auxiliary Procedures and Context Arguments

The *Follow-the-Grammar* recipe is powerful, but sometimes it is not
sufficient. Consider the procedure `number-elements`. This procedure should
take any list `[v0, v1, v2, ...]` and return the list
`[(0, v0), (1, v1), (2, v2), ...]`. To solve the problem, we need to generalize
the problem. We do so by introducing an auxiliary procedure
`number-elements-from` that takes an additional argument that specifies the
number to start from.

Two important observations:

1. The procedure `number-elements-from` has a specification that is independent
of the specification of `number-elements`.

2. The two arguments to `number-elements-from` play two different roles. The
first argument is the list we are working on. It gets smaller at every
recursive call. The second argument, however, is an abstraction of the context
in which we are working. We sometimes call this a context argument or inherited
attribute.

**No Mysterious Auxiliaries**

*When defining an auxiliary procedure, always specify what it does on all
arguments, not just the initial values.*

There are many situations in which it may be helpful or necessary to introduce
auxiliary variables or procedures to solve a problem. Always feel free to do
so.
